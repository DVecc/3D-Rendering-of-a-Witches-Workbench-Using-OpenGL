# CS-330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization
## How do I approach designing software?
When desigining software I start by analyzing the requirments in order to get a good overview of the project so that I am able to break it down into smaller components. The developemnt of this project helped me learn how to create 3D graphics so that I can apply these design skills to my future work in game development.

## How do I approach developing programs?
This project taught me a lot of new development stategies such as how to incorporate and work with third party libraries and how to use processor directives in order to copy files to my different build folders through visual studio. Iteration was a big part of developoing the project starting off with the basics and then evolving them into a fully developed scene by the end of our course work. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Cmputational Graphics and visualizaiton gave me a lot of new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational and professional pathways as they are a huge part of the industry that I aspire to work in. I want to break into the game development industry so getting a start with learning OpenGL is extremely helpful in furthering my education into 3D graphics that will be necessary for me to be knowledgable about when I'm looking for a job in the industry.
